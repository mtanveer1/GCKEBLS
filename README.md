# GCKEBLS: Ensemble Broad Learning System with Graph Convolutional Kernel Machine

Please cite the following paper if you are using this code. Reference: A. Quadir, and M. Tanveer. "Ensemble Broad Learning System with Graph Convolutional Kernel Machine, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (revision submitted).


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
The experiments are executed on a computing system possessing Python 3.11 software, an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2697 v4 processor operating at 2.30 GHz with 256-GB Random Access Memory (RAM), and a Windows-11 operating platform.

We have put a demo of the GCKEBLS model

In this demonstration, the codes are run for fixed hyperparameter

For detailed hyperparameter setting, please refer to the paper.

Description of files: 
demo.py: This is the main file to run selected algorithms on datasets. In the path variable specificy the path to the folder containing the codes and datasets on which you wish to run the algorithm. 
Dataloader.py: To load the dataset.
GraphkernelBLS.py: Solving the optimization problem.

For the detailed experimental setup, please follow the paper. If you find any bugs/issues, please write to A. Quadir (mscphd2207141002@iiti.ac.in).
